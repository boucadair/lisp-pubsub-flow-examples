1.  Introduction

   This document provides a set of flow examples as a companion to the
   LISP PubSub specification [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub].  The document is
   meant to illustrate and assess the behavior of LISP control nodes
   under specific conditions.

   The examples use a simplified/simple setup for the sake of
   illustration.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms defined in [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub].

   The following terms and notations are used in this document:

   init_nonce:  the nonce that is initially included in a Map-Request to
      create a subscription.

   initial subscription request:  the Map-Request that was used to
      create the initial subscription.  This request has the nonce value
      set to init_nonce.

   nonce++:  incremented nonce by 1.

   init_key_id:  the key identifier that was used in the Map-Request
      with init_nonce.

   trans_count:  retransmission counter as per Section 5.7 of [RFC9301].

   trans_timer:  retransmission timer as per Section 5.7 of [RFC9301].

   AT:  Attacker

3.  Initial Successful Subscription

   Figure 1 shows the example of a successful subscription.  The example
   assumes that a security association is in place between the xTR ad
   the Map-Server (Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub]) and that all
   integrity-protection checks are successfully passed.

4.  Successful Notification

   Figure 2 illustrates the example of a successful delivery of
   notification updates that match an existing subscription state.  This
   example assumes that a security association is in place between the
   xTR and the Map-Server (Section 7.1 of [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub]) and
   that all subsequent integrity-protection checks are successfully
   passed.

5.  Successful Notification with Retransmission

   Unlike the example depicted in Figure 2, Figure 3 illustrates the
   behavior that is experienced when a subset of Map-Notify messages are
   lost during their transfer.  This example assumes that at least one
   of these Map-Notify messages is received by the target xTR.

6.  Failed Notification with Retransmission

   Figure 4 assumes that, due to network conditions, all Map-Notifies
   are lost.

         Figure 4: An Example of Failed Notification Delivery

   Note that no specific action is currently specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub] when such a failure occurs.  That is, the
   entry is kept active and future updates will trigger new Map-Notify
   cycles.  Also, the current specification does not recommend a
   behavior (e.g., regular refreshes) so that an xTR avoids maintaining
   stale mappings.  Such details are implementation specific (see, for
   example, Section 7).  In order to accommodate Map-Notify messages
   lost, the nonce checks on the xTR should not be on the exact match vs
   "nonce + 1"; messages with "received nonce >= local nonce + 1" should
   be accepted.

7.  Successful Subscription Update

   Figure 5 illustrates the example of uccessful update of an existing
   subscription.  The triggers for such a refresh are implementation
   specific.

8.  Failed Subscription with Lost Map-Notify-Ack

   This example is similar to Section 3, except that the Map-Notify-Ack
   is not delivered to the Map-Server.  The Map-Server retransmits the
   Map-Notify 3 times and then removes the subscription.  A Map-Notify
   to explicitly indicate the reason for such a removal is also
   generated by the Map-Server.  If the xTR receives this Map-Notify,
   the xTR may decide to send the Map-Request to reinstall back the
   removed state.  The procedure to reinstall the state is similar to
   Figure 1.

9.  Stale Subscriptions

   For various reasons, an xTR may lose its subscriptions (or at least
   the nonce of a subscription).  Note that losing the nonce is not
   compliant with the following from the PubSub specification:

      The xTR MUST keep track of the last nonce seen in a Map-Notify
      received as a publication from the Map-Server for the EID-Record.

   If the same key is used, the Map-Request is likely to be rejected by
   the Map-Server and, thus, stale subscriptions will be maintained by
   the Map-Server.  The request is silently discarded by the Map-Server.
   This behavior is similar to this behavior in [RFC9301]:

      If a Map-Register is received with a nonce value that is not
      greater than the saved nonce, it MUST drop the Map-Register
      message and SHOULD log the fact that a replay attack could have
      occurred.

             Figure 7: An Example of Stale Subscriptions

   If the Map-Server stores all the key-ids that were used by an xTR for
   its subscriptions, the Map-Server may accept overriding an existing
   state without enforcing the nonce check but if and only if a new key
   is used (see Figure 8) and that the new security association
   succeeds.

 Figure 8: An Example of Stale Subscriptions Avoidance with New KEys

   However, the approach in Figure 8 may have scalability issues as the
   Map-Server must store all the key identifiers that were ever used.
   Otherwise, an attacker can replay a message for which the key-id is
   not stored anymore by the Map-Server.  This issue is not encountered
   if LISP-SEC messages are timestamped.

      Note that currently none of LISP specifications use timestamps.

12.  Bootstrapping an xTR

   When first bootrsapped, an xTR may delete any (stale) state that
   might be associated with its provisioned xTR-ID and security
   association.  To that aim, the xTR sends a Map-Request that has only
   one ITR-RLOC with AFI = 0.

   A Map-Notify will be sent back by the Map-Server even if no
   subscription is found as illustrated in Figure 11.

  Figure 14: An Example of Handling of Replayed Initial Subscription

   Suppose now that the xTR deletes it subscription.  An attacker may
   replay valid Map-Request messages that were used for subscription or
   updates.  These messages can't be detected by the Map-Server as being
   replay messages.  The attacker may vary the source IP address of the
   Map-Request to trigger as many Map-Notifies sent to other xTRs.
   These Map-Notify messages will be ignored by the xTR as they don't
   have any matching state.

                               no State

   Note that if LISP-SEC messages are timestamped, the replayed packets
   would be detected and, thus, be silently ignored by the Map-Server.
   Such invalid messages won't then interfere with legitimate Map-
   Requests if the Map-Server has sufficient resources to process the
   timestamp of all received requests.  An example of processing
   timestamped Map-Requests (rate-limit not reached) is depicted in
   Figure 16.

12.1.2.  Replayed Withdrawal

   Figure 17 depicts the example of the exchange that occurs when an
   attacker sends a replayed withdrawal request.  The request will be
   silently discared by the Map-Server if state is already present.

12.1.3.  Replayed Notification Updates

   Figure 18 illustrates the observed exchange when a replayed
   notification update is sent by a misbehaving node (AT) to an xTR.
   This example assumes that the replayed message is a replay of Map-
   Server triggered withdrawal and that a state matching this
   notification is maintained by the xTR.

   Note that if no state is maintained by the xTR, the Map-Notify will
   be silently discarded.
